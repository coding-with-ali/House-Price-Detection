# House-Price-Detection
This Project contains the procedure of finding of predictions which is made to predict the price of a house. Linear Regression and Random Forest are used as a Machine Learning Methodologies. The Dataset used in this Procedure consists of the attributes that defines the price of a house. The dataset contains about 14 Dimensions and the dataset his features that is directly related to the price of the house. I assess the models and explain why they were specifically used and presents the final results. The Dataset used in this Problem was clean enough, but have need some data cleaning and data management, which I will discuss later in this Paper. This paper also contains the process how I reach to the conclusion based on inference and data analysis. The Literature Review of the related works is also presented in this report to expand the scope of discussion for the reader.
